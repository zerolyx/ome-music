# Ome Music

English | [中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

Ome Music is a lightweight Windows music player built for people who just want to open the app and listen.

You do not need to know Node.js, Rust, Vite, URLs, packaging, or command lines to use Ome Music. Download the Windows setup file, install it, open Ome Music, and connect your music sources from the app.

## For Normal Users

1. Open the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/zerolyx/ome-music/releases).
2. Download `Ome.Music_0.3.4_x64-setup.exe`.
3. Double-click the setup file and follow the installer.
4. Open Ome Music from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut.
5. Search a song, import local music, or scan the QR code in Settings to connect NetEase Cloud Music.

The current build is unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen may show a warning. Choose **More info** and **Run anyway** only if you downloaded it from this repository.

## What You Can Do

- Play local music from your computer.
- Search and play available NetEase Cloud Music tracks with your own account session.
- Use Bilibili as a music and video-atmosphere source.
- View covers, lyrics, video atmosphere, and gentle danmaku.
- Keep local listening data on your device.

Ome Music does not bypass memberships, copyright, region restrictions, or platform access rules.

## First Launch

- Local music works without signing in.
- NetEase Cloud Music works best after QR login in **Settings > Music Sources**.
- If a member-only or restricted song still cannot play, Ome Music will show it as unavailable instead of crashing.
- Bilibili can be used for public content first; sign-in unlocks account-only access where available.

## Privacy

- API keys, cookies, sessions, local databases, caches, and logs should never be committed to GitHub.
- Local music files are referenced by path and are not uploaded by Ome Music.
- NetEase Cloud Music and Bilibili use your own session only.
